"""
Repetition profile: three numbers summarising perseveration in a transcript.

Repetition — saying the same word, phrase or sentence over and over — is one
of the clearest surface signs of disordered language, both in aphasia and in
degenerate language-model output ("I can you I I I I I ..."). This module
finds repeated units in a text and reports:

    rep_shortest_len    length (in words) of the shortest repeated unit
    rep_shortest_count  how many times that shortest unit occurs
    rep_max_count       the largest occurrence count of ANY repeated unit

Definition of "repeated" (decided after inspecting many real cases):

  * A word or SHORT phrase counts only when the repeats are CONTINUOUS —
    immediately adjacent, like "the the the" or "I can you I can you".
    (Re-using a short phrase somewhere else in a story is normal language.)
  * A SENTENCE or LONG phrase (LONG_MIN words or more) counts whether the
    repeats are adjacent or scattered anywhere in the text, because saying a
    whole sentence twice is unusual wherever it happens.

Lengths are counted in words, ignoring punctuation.
